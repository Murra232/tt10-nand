## How it works

A NAND gate is a basic digital logic gate that outputs a 0 only when all of its inputs are 1; in every other case, the output is 1. It works by first performing an AND operation on the inputs and then inverting the result. For example, if both inputs A and B are 1, the AND output becomes 1, and the inverter flips it to 0. If either input is 0, the AND output becomes 0, and the inverter flips it to 1. Because of this behavior, the NAND gate is considered a universal gate, meaning you can build any other logic gate, such as AND, OR, or XOR, using only NAND gates. This makes it an important building block in digital circuits and ASIC design.
